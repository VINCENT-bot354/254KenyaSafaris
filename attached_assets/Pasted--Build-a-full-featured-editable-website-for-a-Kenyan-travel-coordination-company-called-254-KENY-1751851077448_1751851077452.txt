> Build a full-featured, editable website for a Kenyan travel coordination company called:

254 KENYA SAFARIS [flag image]

The flag is manually uploaded through the admin panel and should appear after the name "254 KENYA SAFARIS" on all pages. The logo is also uploaded via the admin panel and must appear at the top-left of every page. The size of the logo and every image used throughout the website should be customizable when added or updated via admin pages. There should be default dimensions, but admins can override them directly.
